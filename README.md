# Credit-Risk-Prediction_Logistic-Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the loan status (approved or rejected) of customers based on their credit risk profile using a Logistic Regression model. The objective is to build a model that can accurately determine whether a customer's loan application should be approved, helping financial institutions in their decision-making process.

## Project Components
1. **Problem Statement:** Clearly defined the goal of predicting loan status using logistic regression.
2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collected and cleaned the dataset, handled missing values for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted in-depth analysis to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.
4. **Model Building:** Developed a Logistic Regression model to predict loan status.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarized the findings, highlighting the model's performance and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
The model demonstrates good predictive capabilities, with an 84% accuracy. While the model is effective, further optimization could reduce the number of false positives and negatives. Recommendations include exploring other algorithms and feature engineering to improve model performance.

## Future Work
- Further optimization of the model.
- Experimentation with other machine learning algorithms.
- Potential deployment of the model using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit.
